## What is Daily Fantasy Sports?

Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) is a subset of fantasy sports where participants draft virtual teams of real professional athletes and compete based on the statistical performance of those athletes in actual games. Unlike traditional season-long fantasy leagues, DFS contests typically last a single day or week, allowing players to enter new lineups frequently without long-term commitments.

## How DFS Works in NFL

In NFL DFS, participants select a lineup of players (typically including positions like quarterback, running backs, wide receivers, tight end, defense) while staying within a salary cap constraint. Each player is assigned a salary based on their projected performance, and the total salary of your lineup cannot exceed the cap (commonly $50,000 on platforms like DraftKings or FanDuel). Players earn fantasy points based on real-game statistics such as passing yards, touchdowns, receptions, and rushing yards. The goal is to construct the optimal lineup that maximizes fantasy points while working within the salary constraints.

## Why Analytics Matter

Success in DFS requires more than just knowing footballit demands data-driven decision making. Analyzing player performance trends, matchup data, weather conditions, injury reports, and salary value helps identify underpriced players and optimize lineup construction. This analytics pipeline processes raw NFL statistics, transforms them into actionable insights, and builds data marts to support DFS research and strategy development.
